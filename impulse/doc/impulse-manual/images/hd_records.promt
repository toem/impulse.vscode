A 3D-rendered digital illustration in isometric view.
In the foreground, a large cylindrical database with three stacked white layers, outlined by a thin orange (#f85e1b) line. 
The database contains multiple different 3D white signals and charts distributed across its surface, including digital signals, 
analog waveforms, Gantt chart signals, pie charts, bar charts, line charts, and waveforms. All shapes are smooth, curved, and have soft gray shadows. 
In the background, a highly detailed embedded system â€” a complex white circuit board with various components and pathways, all illuminated by soft, diffused lighting. 
The overall style is modern, minimalistic, structured, with an emphasis on white and subtle gray tones.
