# Event Diagram

The Event Diagram shows event signals, highlighting discrete events, triggers, or markers in signal data. This diagram is particularly useful for analyzing event-driven systems and debugging signal interactions.

## Supporting

This diagram supports:
- PROPERTIES: Provides options to customize the visualization, filtering, and display attributes for event signals.
- CONFIGURATION: Allows users to create, save, and select named configurations for different visualization setups.

## Supported signals

The Event Diagram supports enumeration and struct signals containing an event member.

## Properties

The Event Diagram provides the following configuration options:

- **Show Tags** : Displays tags associated with signals or samples, providing metadata for categorization, filtering, or presentation in diagrams.
- **Show Relations** : Shows relations or links between samples, signals, or members, visualizing dependencies or interactions.
- **Show Labels** : Displays labels or annotations for samples or members, providing descriptive information or highlighting events.
- **Groups** : Allows grouped visualization.
- **Multi-color** : Enables multi-color visualization for better distinction between different events or categories.
- **Colors** : Allows customization of colors used in the diagram for enhanced visual clarity.
- **Value Format** : Specifies how values are represented textually in the diagram, such as binary, decimal, hexadecimal, ASCII, label, or boolean.
- **Value Column Format** : Defines how values in columns are displayed, supporting formats like binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or label for clear tabular visualization.

## Known Limitation
No known limitations.
