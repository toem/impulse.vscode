# Logic Diagram

The Logic Diagram visualizes digital logic signals, showing bit states and transitions for debugging and protocol analysis. This diagram is particularly useful for understanding the behavior of digital systems and protocols.

## Supporting

This diagram supports:
- PROPERTIES: Provides options to customize the visualization, filtering, and display attributes for digital signals.
- CONFIGURATION: Allows users to create, save, and select named configurations for different visualization setups.

## Supported signals

The Logic Diagram supports logic 1 bit signals.

## Properties

The Logic Diagram provides the following configuration options:

- **Show Tags** : Displays tags associated with signals or samples, providing metadata for categorization, filtering, or presentation in diagrams.
- **Show Relations** : Shows relations or links between samples, signals, or members, visualizing dependencies or interactions.
- **Show Labels** : Displays labels or annotations for samples or members, providing descriptive information or highlighting events.
- **Value Format** : Specifies how values are represented textually in the diagram, such as binary, decimal, hexadecimal, ASCII, label, or boolean.
- **Value Column Format** : Defines how values in columns are displayed, supporting formats like binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or label for clear tabular visualization.

## Known Limitation
No known limitations.
