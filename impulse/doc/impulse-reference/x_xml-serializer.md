# Generic XML Reader

The XML Reader is a generic extension for impulse that enables users to import a wide range of XML-based content into the impulse framework. It is designed to support both configuration files (such as view definitions) and records (such as recML files), providing a flexible bridge between external XML data and impulse's powerful visualization, analysis, and processing tools
The XML Reader is commonly used for:
- Importing configuration files (e.g., as shown in the example, for loading and managing view layouts and signal arrangements)
- Importing records stored in the recML format, which can be generated by exporting data from other formats (such as VCD) into XML for archiving, sharing, or further processing
- Integrating other XML-based data sources that conform to impulse's supported schemas
