# Image Diagram

The Image Diagram renders image signals, enabling visualization of pixel or bitmap data within signal traces. This diagram is particularly useful for analyzing image data in signal processing workflows.

## Supporting

This diagram supports:
- PROPERTIES: Provides options to customize the visualization, filtering, and display attributes for image signals.
- CONFIGURATION: Allows users to create, save, and select named configurations for different visualization setups.

## Supported signals

The Image Diagram supports binary signals containing packed images (png,..)

## Properties

The Image Diagram provides the following configuration options:

- **Show Tags** : Displays tags associated with signals or samples, providing metadata for categorization, filtering, or presentation in diagrams.
- **Show Relations** : Shows relations or links between samples, signals, or members, visualizing dependencies or interactions.
- **Show Labels** : Displays labels or annotations for samples or members, providing descriptive information or highlighting events.
- **Value Format** : Specifies how values are represented textually in the diagram, such as binary, decimal, hexadecimal, ASCII, label, or boolean.
- **Value Column Format** : Defines how values in columns are displayed, supporting formats like binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or label for clear tabular visualization.

## Known Limitation
No known limitations.
