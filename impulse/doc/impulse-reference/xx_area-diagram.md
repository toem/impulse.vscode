# Area Diagram

The Area Diagram shows data as filled areas under curves, emphasizing magnitude and trends in signal data. This diagram is particularly useful for visualizing cumulative data and highlighting variations over time.

## Supporting

This diagram supports:
- PROPERTIES: Provides options to customize the visualization, filtering, and display attributes for filled area data.
- CONFIGURATION: Allows users to create, save, and select named configurations for different visualization setups.

## Supported signals

The Area Diagram supports filled area signals, including:
- Cumulative data
- Magnitude trends
- Time-series variations

## Properties

The Area Diagram provides the following configuration options:

- **Show Tags** : Displays tags associated with signals or samples, providing metadata for categorization, filtering, or presentation in diagrams.
- **Show Relations** : Shows relations or links between samples, signals, or members, visualizing dependencies or interactions.
- **Show Labels** : Displays labels or annotations for samples or members, providing descriptive information or highlighting events.
- **Value Format** : Specifies how values are represented textually in the diagram, such as binary, decimal, hexadecimal, ASCII, label, or boolean.
- **Value Column Format** : Defines how values in columns are displayed, supporting formats like binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or label for clear tabular visualization.

## Known Limitation
No known limitations.
