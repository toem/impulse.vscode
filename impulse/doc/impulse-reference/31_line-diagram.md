# Line Diagram

The Line Diagram displays continuous or sampled data as line plots, ideal for analog and time-series signals. This diagram is particularly useful for analyzing trends and variations in signal data over time.

## Supporting

This diagram supports:
- PROPERTIES: Provides options to customize the visualization, filtering, and display attributes for continuous and sampled data.
- CONFIGURATION: Allows users to create, save, and select named configurations for different visualization setups.

## Supported signals

The Line Diagram supports signals providing float or integer value.

## Properties

The Line Diagram provides the following configuration options:

- **Show Relations** : Displays relations or links between data points, visualizing dependencies or interactions.
- **Show Labels** : Displays labels or annotations for data points, providing descriptive information or highlighting events.
- **Show Tags** : Displays tags associated with signals or samples, providing metadata for categorization, filtering, or presentation in diagrams.
- **Interpolated** : Determines whether the data points are connected with interpolated lines.
- **Annotated** : Highlights specific data points with annotations for additional context or emphasis.
- **Draw Axis** : Enables the display of axes for better visualization of signal data.
- **Scale** : Allows scaling of the axis to fit the data range.
- **From** : Specifies the starting value for the axis scale.
- **To** : Specifies the ending value for the axis scale.
- **Type** : Defines the type of axis scaling, such as linear or log10.
- **Value Column Format** : Defines how values in columns are displayed, supporting formats like binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or label for clear tabular visualization.

## Known Limitation
No known limitations.
