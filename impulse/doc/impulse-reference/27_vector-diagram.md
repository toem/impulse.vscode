# Vector Diagram

The Vector Diagram displays vector signals, representing multi-bit or multi-channel data for analysis and visualization. This diagram is particularly useful for understanding complex data structures and their interactions.

## Supporting

This diagram supports:
- PROPERTIES: Provides options to customize the visualization, filtering, and display attributes for vector signals.
- CONFIGURATION: Allows users to create, save, and select named configurations for different visualization setups.

## Supported signals

The Vector Diagram supports all kind of signals.

## Properties

The Vector Diagram provides the following configuration options:

- **Show Tags** : Displays tags associated with signals or samples, providing metadata for categorization, filtering, or presentation in diagrams.
- **Show Relations** : Shows relations or links between samples, signals, or members, visualizing dependencies or interactions.
- **Show Labels** : Displays labels or annotations for samples or members, providing descriptive information or highlighting events.
- **Value Format** : Specifies how values are represented textually in the diagram, such as binary, decimal, hexadecimal, ASCII, label, or boolean.
- **Value Column Format** : Defines how values in columns are displayed, supporting formats like binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or label for clear tabular visualization.

## Known Limitation
No known limitations.
