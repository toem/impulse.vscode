# Generic XML Serializer

The XML Serializer is a generic extension for impulse that enables users to both import (read) and export (write) a wide range of XML-based content within the impulse framework. It supports preference files (such as view definitions), records (such as recML files) and possibly other content. The serializer allows seamless integration of XML data for archiving, sharing, further processing, and exporting impulse records or views to XML format.
Common use cases include:
- Reading and writing preference files (e.g., for loading and managing view layouts and signal arrangements)
- Importing records stored in the recML format, which can be generated by exporting data from other formats (such as VCD) into XML
- Exporting impulse records, views, or signal arrangements to XML for sharing, archiving, or integration with other tools

The XML Serializer supports both uncompressed and compressed XML formats for reading and writing data. Uncompressed files are human-readable and compatible with any XML editor or parser, while compressed files offer reduced storage size and faster transfer.

### File Naming Convention

impulse uses a specific naming convention for file extensions to indicate both the content type and the format:

- The first three letters represent the content type (e.g., `rec` for record, `wal` for wallet).
- The suffix `Ml` indicates uncompressed XML, while `Mz` indicates compressed XML.

For example:
- `recMl` — uncompressed XML record file
- `recMz` — compressed XML record file
- `walMl` — uncompressed XML wallet file
- `walMz` — compressed XML wallet file

This convention helps users and tools quickly identify the type and format of impulse files.

## Supporting

This serializer supports:
- PROPERTIES: Provides options to customize serialisation behavior, filtering, and output attributes for serializers.
- CONFIGURATION: The serializer supports configuration management, allowing users to add and select configurations to override default name patterns and properties. 

## Properties

**Logging and Diagnostics Properties**
The parser integrates with impulse's console logging system, providing configurable verbosity levels for diagnostic output during the import process. Console properties control the level of detail in parsing progress reports, timing statistics, and error information.

## Format

The XML Serializer uses a standard XML format for both reading and writing data. This format ensures compatibility and easy integration with other tools and workflows.

For compressed files, the serializer compresses the XML definition chunk and the data chunks separately. This means the structure and metadata (definition) are stored in one compressed block, while the actual signal or record data is stored in another, optimizing both storage and performance for large datasets.

Below are two examples that illustrate how impulse preferences and data can be represented in XML:

- The first example shows a view configuration, which defines how signals and folders are arranged and displayed in the impulse viewer. This is useful for customizing layouts and organizing signal groups for analysis.
- The second example demonstrates a record, which contains scopes and signals, including sample data. This format is typically used for archiving, sharing, or further processing signal data.
